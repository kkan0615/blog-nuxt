## Overview
Occasionally, it is required to access methods in child component from an outside component.
The `Emit` events can solve most communication between child and parent component. 
However, it is hard to control child component in detail.
In addition, This article will use `<script setup>` along with Typescript. If you're using JavaScript, you need to ignore syntax declaring types. 

## `defineExpose()`
The Vue `defineExpose()` macro allows to access properties in component from parent component. 
The Component will only export variables or functions that you write in Object parameter in `defineExpose()`.
The Parent component only can use variables or functions defined in `defineExpose()`.

## Child component
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

const increaseCount = () => {
  count.value++
}

const setCount = (newCount: number) => {
  count.value = newCount
}

defineExpose({
  count,
  increaseCount,
  setCount,
})
</script>
```
In your child component, import `defineExpose()` API. Add variables or methods that you would like to export into parameter.
As it's mentioned, only properties in  `defineExpose()` are accessible from outside of component.

## Parent component
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'
import ChildComponent from './Child.vue'

const childRef = ref<InstanceType<typeof ChildComponent> | null>(null)

const handleIncrease = () => {
  childRef.value?.increase()
}

const handleSetZero = () => {
  childRef.value?.setCount(0)
}
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <div>
      Parent
      <button @click="handleIncrease">
        increase
      </button>
      <button @click="handleSetZero">
        Set Zero
      </button>
    </div>
    <child-component ref="childRef" />
  </div>
</template>

```
Declaring Template `ref` is necessary to use properties in child component.
In order to get instance type of child component, you have to set `InstanceType<typeof ChildComponent | null` for type of Template `ref` and `null` for default value. 
It will indicates type of component and prevent error lines for variables and functions that is exported.
