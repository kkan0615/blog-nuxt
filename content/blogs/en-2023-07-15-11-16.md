## introduction
This article is going to talk about how to add, Update and Delete a element or elements from Array.

### Examples
Following array will be used for example.
```typescript
interface User {
  name: string
  age: number
}

const arr: User[] = [
  {
    name: 'John',
    age: 20,
  },
  {
    name: 'Arthur',
    age: 32,
  }
]
```


## Add
### Push
The `push()` method in Array adds an element at the end of an array.
```typescript
arr.push({
  name: 'Emily',
  age: 18,
})
```
The element will be at index 2 (Length of array is 3).

### Unshift
The `unshift()` method adds an element at the beginning of an array.
```typescript
arr.unshift({
  name: 'Emily',
  age: 18,
})
```
The element will be at index 0

### Add at a specific index #1
The `splice()` method in Array helps to add an element at specific index.
```typescript
const index  = 1
arr.splice(inedx, 0, {
  name: 'Emily',
  age: 18,
})
```

### Add at a specific index #2
Although the `splice()` method is very simple to use, it change the original array.
```typescript
const newArr = [
  ...arr.slice(0, index),
  {
    name: 'Emily',
    age: 18,
  },
  ...arr.slice(index)
]
```
The `slice()` method returns a new copied array from first start to end (end can be excluded).
It means that this way doesn't change original array.

## Update
### Bracket `[]`
```typescript
arr[0] = {
  name: 'Emily',
  age: 18,
}
```
The bracket `[index]` will change element at number between two brackets. 
It's well-know way, but it's not good idea if you don't want to change original array. 

### `map()`
The `map()` method in Array creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
```typescript
arr = arr.map(el => {
  if (el.name === 'John') {
    return {
      ...el,
      age: 25,
    }
  }
  
  return el
})
```
It will change all matched condition in `if`. In the example, all elements which has John as name will be changed. 

### `splice()`
It is also possible that the `splice()` method replace element at index.
```typescript
arr.splice(inedx, 0, {
  name: 'Emily',
  age: 18,
})
```

## Delete
the `pop()` method in Array deletes last element from an array. It also returns deleted element.
The `pop()` method is opposite to the `push()` method.
### Delete last element `pop()`
```typescript
arr.pop()
```
The `pop()` method returns deleted element.

### Delete first element `shift()`
the `pop()` method in Array deletes first element from an array. It also returns deleted element like the `pop()` method.
The `pop()` method is opposite to the `unshift()` method.
```typescript
arr.shift()
```
The `shift()` method returns deleted element.

### Delete element at specific index
The `splice()` method can be used for removing element at specific index.
```typescript
const index = 1
arr.splice(index, 1)
```

### Delete many elements `filter()`
The `filter()` method in Array returns a new copied array. It's useful to delete multiple elements depending on your preference.
```typescript
arr = arr.filter(el => el.age !== 20)
```
The `filter()` method will not change original array, so you have to reassign data.
