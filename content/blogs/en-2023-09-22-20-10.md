## Introduction
This article is going to talk about how to handle Array State in React. All examples are under React 18 and Typescript version.
Before starting, following array interface is used
```tsx
interface Person {
	id: number
    name: string
}

const [people, setPeople] = React.useState<Person[]>(
  Array.from({length: 3}, (_, i) => ({
    id: i + 1,
    name: `Test: #${i + 1}`,
  }))
)
```
React state is Immutability property, so it's hard to use some methods in Array. Therefore, another way is recommended.
## Add
### At first

Basically, the `unshift()` method in Array is used to add element to array at first. However, it's hard to use it in React. Destructuring assignment helps to resolve it easily.

```tsx
setPeople([
  {
    id: people.length + 1,
    name: 'John'
  },
  ...people,
])
```

### At last
As explained above, Destructuring Assignment is used because the `push` method in Array is also hard to be used.

```tsx
setPeople([
  ...people,
  {
    id: people.length + 1,
    name: 'John'
  },
])
```

### Specific Index
The `slice()` method in Array along with Destructuring Assignment allows to add element at specific index.
The `slice()` method of Array returns a shallow copy of array from start index to end index (Parameters). 
```tsx
const index = 2
setPeople([
  ...people.slice(0, index),
  {
  id: people.length + 1,
  name: 'John'
  },
  ...people.slice(index),
])
```

Example add a element to array at index 2
If you would like to use Array methods such as `push()` and `pop()`, Deep copy with Destructuring Assignment is useful.
```tsx
const newPeople = [...people]
newPeople.push({
    id: people.length + 1,
    name: 'John'
})
setPeople(newPeople)
```

## Update
#### At first
```tsx
const newPeople = [...people]
newPeople[0] = {
	id: newPeople[0].id,
	name: 'New name #' + newPeople[0].id,
} 
setPeople(newPeople)
```

First of all, use a Destructuring Assignment to deep copy the array. Then change index[0] to new data 

#### Specific Index

```tsx
const index = 2
const newPeople = [...people]
newPeople[index] = {
	id: newPeople[index].id,
	name: 'New name #' + newPeople[index].id,
} 
setPeople(newPeople)
```
To change element at specific index, you can use same way as add an element at first. Just add specific index instead of index `0`.

#### Update multiple elements
The `map()` method of Array allows to change multiple elements by conditions.
```tsx
setPeople(people.map(personEl => {
if(personEl.id % 2 === 0) {
  return {
    ...personEl,
    name: `Even - ${personEl.name}`
  }
}

return personEl
}))
```
Above example, change name data containing even id

## Delete
#### At first

```tsx
const newPeople = [...people]
newPeople.shift()
setPeople(newPeople)
```

After deep copy array with Destructuring Assignment, you can use the  `shift()` method of Array. 
Similarly, the `pop` method allows to delete element at last
```tsx
const newPeople = [...people]
newPeople.pop()
setPeople(newPeople)
```

#### Multiple elements
The `filter()` method of Array is good to delete multiple elements by condition.
```tsx
setPeople(people.filter(personEl => personEl.id % 2 === 0))
```
Above example delete all elements containing odd id.
