## Overview
This article is going to discuss what’s the difference between null, undefined and undeclared, well-known javascript interview question.
You can test all codes with [javascript playground](https://codesandbox.io/s/ll8bj?file=/src/index.js)

## Undeclared
Undeclared means a variable is undeclared with an appropriate keyword like ```var```, ```let``` or ```const```.
Accessing an undeclared variable will throw a ```ReferenceError: tes is not defined``` error
## Example
```js
x = 'test string';
console.log(x);
```

## Undefined
A variable has not been assigned yet after it is declared. ```undefined``` is a ```primitive data type```.

### Example
```js
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
console.log(typeof x); // undefined

function test() {};
console.log(test()); // undefined

const testObj = {};
console.log(testObj.fake); // undefined
```
### Note
- A function that does not contain any ```return``` returns ```undefined```
- Non-existent properties in an object returns ```undefined```
- A variable can be set to equal ```undefined```

## Null
A variable is declared and assigned by a value of ```null```.
It means ```null``` must be assigned.
```null``` is also ```primitive data type``` like undefined.

### Example
```js
let x = null;
console.log(x); // null
console.log(typeof x); // object
```
### Note
- ```typeof null``` prints ```object```, but null is ```primitive value```.

#### Why is typeof null "object"
A fix was proposed for ECMAScript (via an opt-in), but was rejected. It would have resulted in typeof null === "null".

## More
- In loosely equal(==), ```undefined == null``` is ```ture```
- In strictly equal (===) ```undefined === null``` is ```false```
