## Overview
```typescript
type LocaleType = 'en' | 'es' | 'ko' | 'jp'
const locales: LocaleType[] = ['en', 'es', 'ko', 'jp']   
```
Declaring type simply create array type of variable with declared type. It looks very simply and easy to use, but it is a hard way to maintain the code in the future. 
Although new type is added in type, array doesn't notify error that new type is missed. This article is going to talk about how to change array to type gracefully.

## `const assertions`
```typescript
const locales = ['en', 'es', 'ko', 'jp'] as ['en', 'es', 'ko', 'jp']
```
There is an alternative way to prevent to write same code twice. 
`const contexts` has been introduced at TypeScript 3.4. `const` keyword only makes array reference immutable which blocks to change.
Add `as const` next to array values instead of duplicated codes. 
`typeof locales[number]` returns all elements in array. Together with `type`, it is allowed to declare immutable tuple type from array. 
Look at the example.
```typescript
const locales = ['en', 'es', 'ko', 'jp'] as const
type Locale = typeof locales[number]
// "en" | "es" | "ko" | "jp"
```
If you just want to get “en”, declare type like `typeof locales[0]`. Because of zero index of locales is "en", typeof locales[0] indicates "en".  

## Conclusion
```typescript
const locales = ['en', 'es', 'ko', 'jp'] as const
type Locale = typeof locales[number]
```
In conclusion, Immutable array can be generated along with`const assertions` which can be used after Typescript 3.4.
`typeof locales[number]` returns all elements in array.

## Bonus - How to get types from Array of objects
Array of objects can be changed to type by key in object. key should be existed in object
```typescript
const loacles = [
  { code: 'en', name: 'English' },
  { code: 'ko', name: '한국어' },
  { code: 'jp', name: '日本語' },
] as const

type loacle = typeof animals[number]['code']
// "en" | "ko" | "jp"
```
Add a key behind of `typeof animals[number]` like`typeof animals[number][key].
