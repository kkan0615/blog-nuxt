# Overview
The article is talking about how to insert an element into array at a specific index.
```push()``` or ```unshift()```function only can add an element at first or last. 
There are two ways to add an item to an array.

# 1 way: Use ```splice()``` method
```splice()``` method changes the contents of array by adding new elements. (It also uses to remove and replace) <br>
```splice()``` method modifies the original array.
## Example code
```javascript
const array = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
console.log('before', array.join()) // before 1,2,3,4,5
array.splice(3, 0, 'A') // insert 'A' at index 3
console.log('after', array.join()) // after 1,2,3,A,4,5
```
- First argument indicates a specific index.
- Second argument is how many element delete. We won't delete any element, so it should be 0.
- Last argument is for element to insert.

## Multiple items
```splice()``` method handles multiple items too.
### Example code
```javascript
const array = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
console.log('before', array.join()) // before 1,2,3,4,5
array.splice(3, 0, 'A', 'B', 'C') // insert 'A' at index 3
console.log('after', array.join()) // after 1,2,3,A,B,C4,5
```
- First and second arguments are same as example of handling a single element.
- Just add elements as much as you want after second argument.

# 2 way: Use ```slice()``` method and destructuring array
```splice()``` method overwrites the original array. On the other hand, ```slice()``` method doesn't modify the original array.
```slice()``` method returns a shallow copy of an array. ```slice()``` method takes two arguments. 
First argument is start index and the other argument is end index. <br>
Destructuring assignment allows to unpack values from arrays. Along with ```...``` syntax, you simply destructure an array.

## Example code
```javascript
const array = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
console.log('before', array.join()) // before 1,2,3,4,5
const newArray = [
  ...array.slice(0, 3),
  'A',
  ...array.slice(3, array.length),
]
console.log('after', array.join()) // after 1,2,3,4,5
console.log('new', newArray.join()) // new 1,2,3,A,4,5
```
- destruct return value of ```slice()``` which starts from 0 index to a specific index 
- Add elements in the middle. It can be single or multiple
- destruct return value of ```slice()``` which starts from a specific index to length of original array.

# Conclusion
If you are fine to overwrite the original array, first way with ```splice()``` method will be the best choice. However,
If you have to keep the original array, use a second way with ```slice()``` method together with destructuring array.
