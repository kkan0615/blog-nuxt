## Overview
WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
Thus, WebSocket will help you to send a data to server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

## Setup Server.
If you already have WebSocket server or know any urls, just pass this section. This sections is going to talk about how to setup Websocket server.
Server is consist of Node.js and Typescript.
Click [link](https://github.com/websockets/ws) to see more details.

### Setup Node.js and Typescript
```bash
npm init -y
npm install @types/node --save-dev
npm install typescript --save-dev
npm install ts-node --save-dev

npm i ws
npm i @types/ws --save-dev
```
`ws` is Node.js WebSocket library. It helps you to develop WebSocket server in Node.js.

### Code
```typescript
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const Port = 5174

const ws = new WebSocketServer({
    port: Port,
});

ws.on('connection', (ws) => {
    ws.on('error', console.error)

    ws.on('message', (data) => {
        console.log(`Received: ${data}`);

        ws.send('Send back');
    });

    ws.send('Hello World');
});

console.log(`New WebSocket sever starts at ws://localhost:${Port}`);
```
Make a file named `websocket.ts`. Copy and Past Code into file that you just created.
If you type command `ts-node websocket.ts`, you will see `ws://localhost:5174` log in your command line.
WebSocket server will starts with `ws` or `wss` according to your secure setting. They are very similar with `http` and `https`

## First way: `ws` package.
Implement WeSocket client a same package that we used in Server. `ws` provides client utilities.
Click [link](https://github.com/websockets/ws) to see more details.

### Installation
```bash
npm i ws
npm i @types/ws --save-dev
```
Install the package into your client (Vue 3 project) before you start.

### Code
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { onBeforeUnmount, ref } from 'vue'

const webSocket = ref(new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5174'))
const messageFromSever = ref('')
const isConnected = ref(false)

webSocket.value.onopen = (e) => {
  console.log('onopen', e)
  isConnected.value = true
  webSocket.value.send('Hello I am testing')
}

webSocket.value.onmessage = (e) => {
  console.log('onmessage', e)
  messageFromSever.value = e.data
}

webSocket.value.onclose = (e) => {
  console.log('onclose', e)
}

webSocket.value.onerror = (e) => {
  console.log('onerror', e)
}

onBeforeUnmount(() => {
  webSocket.value.close()
})

</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <div>
      Connection: {{ isConnected ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected' }}
    </div>
    <div>
      From sever: {{ messageFromSever }}
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```
Create any name vue file then copy and past the code.
The `isConnected` variable is used for checking connecting between WebSocket server and client success.
The `messageFromSever` variable will contain a message from server. 
Depending on data from server, it could not be string type. (It will be string if you followed the server section)

### Open and error
`onopen` event will fire when client successfully connect with WebSocket server.
`onerror` message will be fire when connection meets any errors on connection.

### Send data
`send` function will send a message to WebSocket server.
`send` allows string or a binary format such as `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`.
The message from server is contained in e.data. If it could be any type according to data.

#### Rate Limiting
In order to prevent to make your network connection slow, you can check buffer amount.
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  if (socket.bufferedAmount == 0) {
    socket.send('some data...');
    clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, 100);
```
every 100ms examine the socket and send more data
only if all the existing data was sent out

### Receive message
`onmessage` is event that receive message from Server.

### close handling
`onclose` event will fire when client close connection with server. Close event includes code (number), reason(string) and wasClean.
wasClean is boolean type of data used for checking it's cleaned up.

## Second Way: `useWebSocket` in `vueuse` module.
[vueuse](https://vueuse.org/) module will be used in second way. The vueuse is collection of Vue composition utilities. 
Although `Vueuse` module has a plenty of utilities, we will use `useWebSocket` in order to handle WebSocket connection.

### Installation
```bash
npm i @vueuse/core
```
Install module before you use it. It contains types, so you don't need to install types.
If you would like to read documentation first, here is the [link](https://vueuse.org/core/useWebSocket/).

### Code
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { onMounted } from 'vue'
import { useWebSocket } from '@vueuse/core'

const { data, status, send } = useWebSocket('ws://localhost:5174')

onMounted(() => {
  send('Hello I am testing')
})

</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <div>
      Status: {{ status }}
    </div>
    <div>
      From sever: {{ data }}
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```
Status has three values including `OPEN`, `CONNECTING`, `CLOSED`
If you pass `autoReconnect` option, it tries to reconnect on erros automatcally
```typescript
const { data, status, send } = useWebSocket('ws://localhost:5174', {
  autoReconnect: true,
})
```
```typescript
const { status, data, close } = useWebSocket('ws://websocketurl', {
  autoReconnect: {
    retries: 3,
    delay: 1000,
    onFailed() {
      alert('Failed to connect WebSocket after 3 retries')
    },
  },
})
```
You can prevent time of calling and delay with options.

### Open
Once you enter the page, `useWebSocket` will try to connect with WebSocket in link automatically.

### Send
`send` is the function that sends a message to WebSocket server.

### Receive message
Whenever you receive message from server, data will be changed to message that came from server.

### Close
You have to close connection in `onBeforeUnmount` By contrast, you are not required to call `close()` function before you leave the page.
The reason is that `useWebSocket` calls `close()` if you don't call any `close()`.
