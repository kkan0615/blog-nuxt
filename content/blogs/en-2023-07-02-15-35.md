## introduction
This article is going to talk about 5 ways to depp copy objects in JavaScript.
Before we get started, we will look into what's the different between Shallow copy and Deep copy. 

## `Shallow copy` vs `Deep copy`
`Shallow copy` stores references of objects to the original memory address. 
On the other hands, `Deep copy` stores copies of the object's value

### Shallow copy examples
```js
const a = {
  name: 'a', 
}

const copies = a
cloned.name = 'new name'
console.log(a) // {name: "new name"}
console.log(cloned) // {name: "new name"}
```
cloned variable which is copied with `=` operator changed property `name` in `a` variable.
`Shallow copy` reflects changes made to the new and copied object in the original object, but `Deep copy` doesn't reflect changes.

## Deep copy
From now on, we are going to talk about Deep copy.

## Deep copy - `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`
`JSON.stringify()` method converts JavaScript value like primitive values, Object and Array to JSON string.
`JSON.parse()` method parses a JSON string to JavaScript. It's contrary to `JSON.stringify()`.
Combining both of these method allows to create a copy of an object.

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Arthur',
  age: 20,
  address: {
    country: 'Canada'
  },
  setAge: function (newAge) {
    this.age = newAge
  }
}

const cloned = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(user))
cloned.name = 'John'
cloned.address.country = 'Japan'
console.log(user) // {name: "Arthur", age: 20, address: {country: "Canada"}
console.log(cloned) // {name: "John", age: 20, address: {country: "Japan"}
```
You can see cloned doesn't change original value. It doesn't change nested object too. However, this way can't copy function value
```js
const user = {
  name: 'Arthur',
  age: 20,
  address: {
    country: 'Canada'
  },
  setAge: function (newAge) {
    this.age = newAge
  }
}

const cloned = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(user))
cloned.setAge(5)
```
You'll get `TypeError: cloned.setAge is not a function` error message.

### Pros
- Deep copies nested objects
- Well known coding style

### Cons
- It doesn't copy functions
- Low performance


## Depp copy - `Object.assign()`
`Object.assign()` method copies all values from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the modified target object.

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Arthur',
  age: 20,
  address: {
    country: 'Canada'
  },
  setAge: function (newAge) {
    this.age = newAge
  }
}

const cloned = Object.assign({}, user)
cloned.name = 'John'
cloned.address.country = 'Japan'
cloned.setAge(5)
console.log(user) // {name: "Arthur", age: 20, address: {country: "Japan"}
console.log(cloned) // {name: "John", age: 5, address: {country: "Japan"}
```
Advantage of `Object.assign()` method is that `Object.assign()` method copies not only objects but also functions, so you can use function in object. 

### Pros
- Deep copies objects and functions

### Cons
- It doesn't copy nested objects

## Deep copy - The `...` spread Syntax.
The `...` spread syntax allows iterable to be expanded

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Arthur',
  age: 20,
  address: {
    country: 'Canada'
  },
  setAge: function (newAge) {
    this.age = newAge
  }
}

const cloned = {...user}
cloned.name = 'John'
cloned.address.country = 'Japan'
cloned.setAge(5)
console.log(user) // {name: "Arthur", age: 20, address: {country: "Japan"}
console.log(cloned) // {name: "John", age: 5, address: {country: "Japan"}
```
Unfortunately, The spread syntax doesn't copy nested object like `Object.assign()` method. However, there is a way to copy nested object

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Arthur',
  age: 20,
  address: {
    country: 'Canada'
  },
  setAge: function (newAge) {
    this.age = newAge
  }
}

const cloned = {...user,
  address: {
    ...user.address
  }
}
cloned.address.country = 'Japan'
console.log(user) // {name: "John", age: 20, address: {country: "Canada"}
console.log(cloned) // {name: "John", age: 20, address: {country: "Japan"}
```
If you use the spread syntax in nested object, they will be deep copied.

### Pros
- Deep copies objects and functions
- Easy to use

### Cons
- Nested object can be deep copy, but it's very annoying to use.

## Deep copy - lodash library

The `lodash` is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras. 
The `lodash` provides utility called `cloneDeep()` method.
```js
import _ from 'lodash'

const user = {
  name: 'Arthur',
  age: 20,
  address: {
    country: 'Canada'
  },
  setAge: function (newAge) {
    this.age = newAge
  }
}

const cloned = _.cloneDeep(user)
cloned.name = 'John'
cloned.address.country = 'Japan'
cloned.setAge(5)
console.log(user) // {name: "Arthur", age: 20, address: {country: "Canada"}
console.log(cloned) // {name: "John", age: 5, address: {country: "Japan"}
```
`cloneDeep()` method in `lodash` library allows deep copy, nested object and functions.
### Pros
- Deep copies objects, nested objects and functions

### Cons
- You should install the library, and it will increase your project size.

## Deep copy `structuredClone()`
The `structuredClone()` global method creates a deep clone of a given value using the structured clone algorithm.
```js
const user = {
  name: 'Arthur',
  age: 20,
  address: {
    country: 'Canada'
  },
  setAge: function (newAge) {
    this.age = newAge
  }
}

const cloned = structuredClone(user)
cloned.name = 'John'
cloned.address.country = 'Japan'
// cloned.setAge(5) // ERROR!
console.log(user) // {name: "Arthur", age: 20, address: {country: "Japan"}
console.log(cloned) // {name: "John", age: 5, address: {country: "Japan"}
```

### Pros
- Deep copies nested objects
- Better performance than `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.

### Cons
- It doesn't copy functions
- It cannot clone DOM elements
- Low version of browser and Node.js may not supported
